                <div id="blurb"><p>Around 1850, Zepheniah bought a large amount of land on the United States by petition of Redmond and Blutarch, to expand the munitions business. When he and his sons arrived there, they discovered the gravel pits and dustbowls that he had purchased were useless; in addition, Zepheniah had contracted numerous illnesses due to the trip made across the world. With his last will and testament, Zepheniah set up the events of the Team Fortress series by leaving half of his useless new land to each of his sons â€“ for them to fight over for the rest of their lives - as a punishment for their behavior that made him lose a fortune and his life. Mann Co. was given to Barnabus Hale who was his former private detective and deputy. He also left Elizabeth the "miracle gravel" cache that he discovered on a trip to "Terra Australis". According to him, Gray Mann, their secret brother raised by Eagles, had resurfaced the year before and wanted to blackmail him for it, so he entrusted Elizabeth with it, to keep it secret and safe. You will side with one of the Mann brother's teams of mercenaries to take over the small towns and outposts in the gravelpits of America!</p></div>

                <p>The first target you will go after will be the Smith Brothers lumbermill, this large complex is directly in the way of Redmonds/Blutarch's new railroad that will help bring Gravelanium to the expances of the territories. You will need to take out his dime-a-dozen thugs. Then you have the choise of sabotaging the sawmill itself stopping production for long enough to take out what you can when all the workers are gone. Option 2 is doing this loud which suits your MO. Blow it all to hell, this'll cost those damned brothers for getting in the way of out superior gravel!</p></div>

                <p>Alright chumps, this one needs to be dealt with quick-like. Matthew's has the gall to set up her own Gravel company and gives the damned stuff away for free?! THE FOOL! What you need to do is grab as much as you can with the trucks ive provided. This one is personal so I need you to do a few extras for me. </p>
					<ul><li>Take down the company flag</li>
					<li>Break into her office and grab something to fly from the flagpole</li>
					<li>Raise them up the flagpole</li></ul></div></section>

                <p>Damned fools are at it again! They've banded together under the wings of Scott, not only is he a socialist but he's Irish to match! Anyway the little man has caught on to our tricks and has formed his own team of mercenaries comprised of Billy the Kid, Stonewall Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Alfred Nobel, John Henry, Nikola Tesla, Sigmund Freud, Davy Crockett, and Fu Manchu. A mixed rabble that i'm sure you'll all manage to put in the ground. Dead, I mean dead. Did you get that? ...NOW GO! </p></div>
